Create a Django project: After installing Django, we will create a Django project. We wil do this by running the following command in our terminal or command prompt: django-admin startproject projectname

Create an app: After creating a project, we will create an app. We can create an app by running the following command in our terminal or command prompt: python manage.py startapp appname

Create a database: Next, we will create a database. Django supports multiple databases such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. We can configure our database in the settings.py file.

Create HTML and CSS templates: After setting up the database,we create HTML and CSS templates for our web application. We create templates in the templates directory of our app.

Write Python code: After creating the templates, we write Python code to connect our HTML templates to the database. Then we create views in our app and write Python code to retrieve data from the database and render it in the HTML templates.

Connect Django to the database: Finally,we will  Django to the database. We will do this by configuring our database settings in the settings.py file.

Once we have completed these steps, we will have a Django web application that connects HTML, CSS, Python code, and a database.
